Archive of projects made during the **"ISM 6251 - Data Science Programming"** course at the University of South Florida. The contents covered in this course are: Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, Ensemble Techniques, Text Mining, Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Autoencoders. The following projects correspond to some of those contents:

* **Autoencoder-MNIST:** Retrained Autoencoder for MNIST dataset. Retraining was done to include unseen data (5 images/versions of the letter A).
* **BreastCancer-Prognosis:** A project to predict Invasive Breast Cancer Recurrence with linear regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
* **DTs-UBank:** Decision Trees - Universal Bank Dataset. RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV were used to identify the best parameters for each model tested.
* **RNN-Nike:** Recurrent Neural Networks for NIKE closing prices. Prediction of the 10-day closing stock price of NIKE from 2010 to 2023. Four techniques were tested: RNN, LTSM, GRU, and Conv1D.
* **SVM-LawnMower_ownership:** Support Vector Machines. The study was done using SVM classification with linear, rbf, and polynomial kernels to predict the lawn mower ownership feature of the RisingMower.csv data.
* **Text-Mining-Classification:** Text Mining classification - SVD. Prediction of categories (graphics, hockey, medical) of discussion posts.
